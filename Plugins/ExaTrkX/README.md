# Exa.TrkX Plugin

This plugin contains a track finding module based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) which is developed by the [Exa.TrkX](https://exatrkx.github.io/) team.

## Building

To build the plugin, enable the appropriate CMake options:

```cmake
cmake -B <builddir> -S <srcdir> \
  -D ACTS_BUILD_PLUGIN_EXATRKX=ON \
  -D ACTS_BUILD_EXAMPLES_EXATRKX=ON \
  -D ACTS_BUILD_EXAMPLES_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON \
  -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-installed-dependencies-if-not-in-default-paths>
```

This plugin is known to build without erros with (as of Februrary 2022):

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) versions 8 and 9
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) v11.5.1
* [cugraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph) v22.02.00
* [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/) v1.10.2 for CUDA version 10.2 and cxx-11-abi ([download](https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu102/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.10.2%2Bcu102.zip))
* [ONNX](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) v1.10.0 with CUDA support enabled

There were experienced problems with recent GCC 11 versions and CUDA 11.6. A docker image with all dependencies can be found [here](https://github.com/acts-project/machines).

## Running

The Examples of this plugin provide a python-script using the python-bindings to demonstrate the use of the track finding module. The script can be found here:

```
/Examples/Scripts/Python/ExaTrkX.py
```

In order that python can find the `acts.examples` module, setup your `PYTHONPATH` with `source <builddir>/python/setup.sh.

## Required files

The track finding module requires some ONNX-files that descripe the used neural networks. These files are currently not provided within the ACTS repository.
